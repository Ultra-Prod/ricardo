## Language Synchronization ##

Each products listing can have its own language settings. The Ricardo.ch platform allows to publish product content in two languages: German and French
You can define if you want to publish the content in one or two languages and set which language is the default one.

To help you to configure the setting when you create a product listing, the extension will detect automatically which language you use for the current website and its store views.
Those information will be saved automatically into the products listing and you will have the possibility to change it.

To change the settings of the language in a product listing. Edit a products listing and activate the tab "General" and search the language block.
- Product languages to synchronize to Ricardo.ch: select if you want to publish the content in Ricardo on the french or german ricardo.ch website
- Default language to publish: if you want to publish your products on all ricardo.ch websites, you can set which language to use by default in case you do not have the content of your product in the target language
- Store View for XYZ: select in which store view you have the language XYZ. If you have set your Magento language settings at the level of "Websites", please create a new products listing for this website
